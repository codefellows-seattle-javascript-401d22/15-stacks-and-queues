===

## Requirements

Implement a `Queue` constructor.

* implement `enqueue` as a method of your `Queue` constructor
  * this should add an item to the queue
* implement `dequeue` as a method of your `Queue` constructor
  * this should remove an item from the queue

Implement a `Stack` constructor.

* implement `push` as a method of your `Stack` constructor
  * this should add an item to the stack
* implement `pop` as a method of your `Stack` constructor
  * this should remove an item from the stack

## Submission Instructions

1. Together with your assigned partner, pseudocode an implementation for a `Stack` constructor and a `Queue` constructor on the whiteboard.
1. Your partner (or you) should then begin pseudocoding and whiteboarding the solution to a method implementation of their choice.
1. Using the included `whiteboard-rubric.pdf`, evaluate your partner and provide feedback where necessary.
1. Swap roles.
1. Take a picture of your completed whiteboarding rubric and submit in Canvas.
